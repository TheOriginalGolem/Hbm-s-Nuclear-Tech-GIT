# <u>**Golem's HBM Nuclear Tech Mod 1.12.2 Fork**</u>

This is my fork of the original 1.12.2 port made by [Drillgon2000](https://github.com/Drillgon200/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT). This is meant to be a maintained fork mainly for bug fixes and if possible, newer features from the original mod by [HBM](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT).

The latest version can be found on https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hbms-nuclear-tech-mod-reloaded or under the [releases page](https://github.com/TheOriginalGolem/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT/releases).
